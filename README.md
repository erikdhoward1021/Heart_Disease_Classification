## Installation
Describe the steps required to install the project dependencies. Include any specific versions or configurations that are necessary. For example:  
To use our machine learning model, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.


## Usage
Explain how to use the project, including any command-line arguments or configuration options. Provide examples or code snippets if applicable. For example:  
1. Run the `predict.py` script in `/scripts` with the necessary input data.
2. The script will output the predicted results based on the trained model found in `/models`.

## Data
Describe the data used in the project, including its source, format, and any preprocessing steps that were applied. Provide instructions on how to access or download the data.

## Model Training
Explain the process of training the machine learning model. Include details on the algorithms, techniques, and hyperparameters used. Provide code snippets or scripts if available.

## Evaluation
Describe how the model's performance is evaluated. Include the metrics used, any visualization techniques, and the expected output. Provide code snippets or scripts if available.

## ROI KPIs
To measure the success of our machine learning model, we will track the following ROI KPIs:
1. $PLACEHOLDER$: Describe the first ROI KPI and how it will be measured.
2. $PLACEHOLDER$: Describe the second ROI KPI and how it will be measured.
3. $PLACEHOLDER$: Describe the third ROI KPI and how it will be measured.

## Success Criteria
We will consider our project successful if we achieve the following:
1. Develop a fully functional machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
2. Achieve a baseline performance metric that exceeds a predefined threshold.
3. Iterate on the pipeline by augmenting with additional data, performing feature engineering, and incorporating feedback from end users.
4. Improve the performance metric by a significant margin compared to the baseline.
